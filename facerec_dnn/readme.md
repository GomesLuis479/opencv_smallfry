* facenet.cpp -- a shootout between facenet, lbph, and ann_mlp (with bif features) on att[grayscale] and (a subset of) lfw[color] faces
* facerec_dnn.cpp -- an online (webcam based) demo of using the dnn faccenet with  SVM as a classifier
* facerec2.cpp -- same a above just using straight L2 norm
* fr_lfw_dnn.cpp -- trying out with the original lfw (verification) task, using the datasets fraework from opencv_contrib
* lfw40_crop.zip --  40 persons from lfw (a 10 images), to compare to att (not sure though, if my selection is "fair" here)
