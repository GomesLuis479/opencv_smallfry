various attempts to use 3d lbp features.

*hockey: http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/data/violentflows/violent_flows.pdf
  2000 fight/nofight sequences from icehockey games
  (works quite good, 91/100 fight, 85/100 nonfights detected)

*aslan : the same/not-same challenge on 3660 video sequences (action recognition)
  (not better than random)

*ckplus: the extended cohn-kanade facial expression dataset. 327 labelled emotions

*cam: a small demo to visualize the xy xz yz planes. also demonstrates stabilizing with a mosse tracker
